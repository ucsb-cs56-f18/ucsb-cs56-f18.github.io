bio: >
   Hi! I'm Eliza (she/her/hers), a 4th year Computer Science Major looking forward to graduating this Spring! I originally entered UCSB as a CCS Art Major, but was drawn to the logical and detailed nature of CS during my freshman year. When I began the process to transfer into CS, I often felt like an outsider due to my limited experience in the field. Learning the intricacies of coding was one of my biggest challenges. However, when I sought help from friends and other students in class, their enthusiasm and patience improved my confidence when programming. Gradually, I became more comfortable coding and officially switched majors late sophomore year. I understand what it's like to feel intimidated by unfamiliar concepts, so I'd like to help my fellow peers any way I best can. CS56 was my favorite lower-division course because I learned more about real-world programming practices (Git/GitHub, legacy code) and took part in Professor Conrad's energetic and passionate lectures.
   
   My areas of interest in CS include autonomous vehicles, human-computer interaction, and UI/UX design. During my previous internship, I rode in one of Waymo's cars, designed the UI for an online educational service, and helped create a marketing plan to promote the service. I still enjoy art-related hobbies such as illustration, photography, and fashion design. I'd love to talk about any of these topics if you have questions or just want to chat!
