bio: >
   Hi! My name is Meredith (Yiyang Xu) (She/Her/Hers) and I’m a third year computer science major. I’m really excited to be a mentor for CS56 this quarter. I was an actuarial science major when I first got into UCSB and switched to CS after my first year. I can still remember all the stress of switching to a new major. While I don’t have much professional industry experience, I enjoy doing some side projects. I learned HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and Javascript and used them to build a personal website. I would recommend doing some side projects in your spare time especially if you’re interested in learning some new development tools. Moreover, personal projects would make you stand out among other candidates when you’re looking for an internship. I remember when I took CS56, my mentors really helped me a lot when I was stuck on some difficult programming problems. Therefore, I’m thrilled that I have the opportunity to offer help to students who may be in the same situation as I was. I would love to help you with any course material and also strengthen my Java knowledge. Also, feel free to chat with me about switching majors, choosing classes, and how to get started on your personal projects. Outside of school, I love watching and playing basketball, traveling, and hiking. If you know some cool hiking trails, please let me know! Also, this is my first time being a mentor so if you think there’s something I need to improve, please give me some suggestions. You can always reach out to me via email (yiyangxu@ucsb.edu) or sending me a note on Piazza.
