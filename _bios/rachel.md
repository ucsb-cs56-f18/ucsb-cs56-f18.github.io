   Hey guys! My name is Rachel and I'm a third year CS major! I recently transferred to UCSB this summer of 2018 and took this very same CS56 class. I think its an extremely useful class that will help you in real-world programming and am excited to help you all. If you're a new transfer student (or not!) and have any question about UCSB, academically, socially, or anything else, feel free to ask me any questions!
